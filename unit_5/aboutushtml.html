		<h2>Instructor: Nicholas Karsant</h2>
		<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Aperiam earum qui explicabo suscipit assumenda at! Veniam tempore, optio similique quo, nesciunt, libero porro corrupti ipsam nihil inventore mollitia atque. Quae.</p>


		<h2>Mission</h2>
		<p> The goal of Flow Arts Dojo...
			benefits of flow
		</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Classes</h2>
		
		<h3>Body Fundamentals</h3>
		<p>Aimed toward absolute beginners, this class will explore the capabilities of the
			human body, providing a variety of exercises to improve strength, flexibility, range of motion, 
			and agility. Goals for this class are cartwheels and rudimentary handstands.
		</p>


		<h3>Poi</h3>
		<p>Poi was first used as a traditional dance of Malori people in the South Pacific, and has 
			evolved to the international performance prop most commonly associated with fire spinning, 
			or fire dancing.  
		</p>
	
	
		<h3>Rope Dart</h3>
		<p>Originally an ancient Chinese weapon, the rope dart has not changed in 
			thousands of years.  With a weighted end attached to a 10-12 foot rope, this
			soft-prop is used to make complex empty knots around the body that can be quickly, 
			and surprisingly, released as a shot that extends farther than most weapons. 
			While the actual prop has not changed since it's inception, its varied use has
			evolved to include many different styles of use.</p>


		<h3>Contact Staff</h3>
		<p> Contact Staff refers to manipulating a staff without using hands to grab 
			the staff. Many of the modern contact staff techniques come from baton twirling as well as the 
			Chinese art of Fei-Cha. Contact Staff artists create remarkable visual effects since the 
			staff movement seems so smooth and controlled while the performers movements remain subtle.
		</p>

	

		<h3>Dragon Staff</h3>
		<p> Derived from another Chinese weapon, turned performance art, known as <a href="https://youtu.be/RLtoH9NtY2I">fei cha</a>,
			or flying fork/trident, Dragon Staff is similar to Contact Staff but includes a rolling action,
			that significantly alters how the prop moves and is manipulated.  The constant rotation of the staff
			provides a stability in balance that makes it, arguably, more accessible to newcomers, while also 
			providing sufficient complexity for advanced students to continue learning and exploring. 
		</p>

		<h2>Advanced Classes</h2>
		<p>Certain skills are required to take an advanced class.  Please speak with the instructor to see if you qualify.</p>
		
		<h3>Nunchucks</h3>
		<p>Prerequisite: Competency with poi.
			<br>
			Made popular by Bruce Lee and the Ninja Turtles, nunchucks, like rope dart, is a soft prop,
			fun to play with, and infamously difficult to master.  These classes will build upon the skills 
			from the poi class, illustrating the differences, and teaching skills that favor exhibition and 
			performance over weapon form.
		</p>

		
		<h3>Introduction to Fire Spinning</h3>
		<p>Prerequisites: Competency with at least one prop. Calmly recover from mistakes.  Purchase a fire prop of your choosing.
			<br>
			This two class series will provide students with the ability to perform with fire,
			with heavy emphasis on safety protocols.  First class will focus on safety, the nature 
			of spinning fire, and getting comfortable with flames close to your body.  The second class 
			will emphasize practicing musicality and being around other people spinning fire, as well as 
			being able to put out a prop that is still lit and other tips for taking care of your fire prop.
		</p>
		

		<h3>Introduction to Puppyhammer</h3>
		<p> Prerequisites: Competency with poi and rope dart. Contact staff encouraged but not required.
			<br>
			Not nearly as violent as the name may imply, the puppyhammer is another prop derived from 
			a Chinese weapon known as meteor.  Meteors are characterized by a length of rope with an 
			equal amount of weight at each end.  Like Dragon Staff, this prop has traveled far from is martial
			arts roots and become more of a performance prop.  Incorporating skills and movements from poi,
			rope dart, meteor, chain whip, and contact staff, puppyhammer is a unique mixture of props,
			offering a wide range of movements, tricks and combinations unrivaled by other flow props.

		</p>

		

		<h3>Cyr Wheel</h3>
		<p>
			Pronounced "seer", cyr wheel is an acrobatic circus apparatus designed by Daniel Cyr in 2003. 
			Utilizing centrifugal forces and balance, a performer is able to complete amazing 
			and beautiful acrobatic movements while riding this relatively recent addition 
			to the circus arts.  Many classes/hours will be spent working up to the basic
			riding step called the waltz.  Click <a href="https://youtu.be/GLlpi-0_lB0">here</a> to see it in action.
